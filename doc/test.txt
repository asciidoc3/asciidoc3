== First Paragraph ==
Here comes something, nobody cares about this stuff. And now *bold*, and this ist _italic_, and the last +monospaced+. After this (hidden +) +
begins a new line.
The german umlauts and two other non-ascii glyphs / letters: äöüÄÖÜß € (euro) ¢ (cent). 

== Second Paragraph
This sample comes with an image. The file name paths are relative to the location of the referring document:
image:redsquare.jpg[caption]
The "caption" in brackets corresponds to HTML alt="caption" and is not seen in the browser. The image is rendered inline; this is perhaps not preferred footnote:[or is it?], we have a footnote here.

Another snippet:

image:redsquare.jpg[caption]


and the image at the center of the line.

New line and the image at the beginningfootnote:[footnote without space] of the line.

New line:

image::redsquare.jpg["caption",align="center"]

We see the image at the center of the line. At the end a link: Visit the http://www.asciidoc3.org[home of asciidoc3]! +
