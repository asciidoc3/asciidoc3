= AsciiDoc3 Quickstart

== Start with AsciiDoc3
- You don't need admin/root-access to try AsciiDoc3 - you have to install 'local'. 
- Download the tarball / zip-file of the current AsciiDoc3 distribution, see link:download.html[here].
- Deflate the tarball / zip-file in an appropriate directory, see link:install.html[here].
- Be sure 'python3' is in your PATH and starts Python3, see link:install.html[here].
- To uninstall, see link:install.html[here].


[NOTE]
Experienced AsciiDoc (Python2) users please note: +
The use of a file named 'asciidoc.conf' is not allowed in AsciiDoc3 - a file with this name will be ignored! +
Use 'asciidoc3.conf' instead.


== Testing your installation
In your new directory, e.g. 'asciidoc3', you'll find the following input files: +
- ./doc/test.txt: a small doc to see everything's ok (-> asciidoc3.py works ...), +
- ./doc/userguide.txt: this is nothing else than the 'AsciiDoc3' - User Guide.


=== First Test

Open a terminal, go to your directory and start

------------
$ cd ~/asciidoc3-3.0.1/doc

$ python3 ../asciidoc3.py -n -a icons -a toc -o test.html test.txt
------------

or, when you have installed AsciiDoc3 system wide (su ./installscript) 

------------
$ asciidoc3 -n -a icons -a toc -o test.html test.txt
------------

You'll find a new file test.html. It shows only a few features of AsciiDoc3. 

=== UserGuide

Open a terminal, go to your directory and start

------------
$ cd ~/asciidoc3-3.0.1/doc

$ python3 ../asciidoc3.py -a toc -n -a icons -o userguide.html userguide.txt
------------

or 

------------
$ asciidoc3 -a toc -n -a icons -o userguide.html userguide.txt
------------

The new file 'userguide.html' contains the current version of the user guide ... almost complete now. To see the insignificant differences between AsciiDoc3 and AsciiDoc2, take a look link:userguide.html[here]. Processing 'userguide.txt' makes use of many AsciiDoc3-features. 

To make a "good-looking" pdf out of userguide.txt, try

------------
$ a2x3 -f pdf userguide.txt
------------

or

------------
$ python3 ../a2x3.py -f pdf userguide.txt
------------

[NOTE]
Depending on your directory layout - when your AsciiDoc3-folder is 'not' a subdirectory of your home-directory - you may encounter an error message like this: +
Error: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: <your_asciidoc3-folder_not_under_home>/test.pdf +
You can ignore that, the pdf is there and complete! That's probably a dblatex-issue (?) - I am working on it ... +
As a workaround you may use 'sudo python3 a2x3.py -f pdf userguide.txt' or the system wide command 'a2x3.py -f pdf userguide.txt' or the following option --fop.

To make an even better(?) looking pdf, you may use option 'fop' - this requires that you have installed 'fop'.

------------
$ a2x3 -f pdf --fop userguide.txt
------------

or

------------
$ python3 ../a2x3.py -f pdf --fop userguide.txt
------------


=== Verbose Option

To see what is going on when asciidoc3.py or a2x3.py works, add the option 'verbose':

------------
$ asciidoc3 -v -n -a icons -o test.html test.txt

$ a2x3 -f pdf -v --fop userguide.txt
------------



== More Examples and Further Information

In the directory ~/asciidoc3/doc you find some more files you may use as examples to study the features of AsciiDoc3. +
Please note 'asciidoc3port.txt': this file contains a detailed report on the porting efforts. Try 'a2x3 -f pdf -v --fop asciidoc3port.txt' to produce a PDF.
