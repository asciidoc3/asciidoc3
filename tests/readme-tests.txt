AsciiDoc3 Tests README
======================================

To test the features of AsciiDoc3, please use the information given in the 'userguide',
the 'quickstart', and the files in directory ../doc.

Previous versions of AsciiDoc(3) provided some software tests in the directory 'tests'.
They were used mainly by developers - and only sporadicly by 'real world' users.

So this directory is empty, you can find the relevant (partly new implemented) tests
and unittests by and by in the online repo, see on a daily basis asciidoc3.org. The 
tests will be added again to one of the next releases.
