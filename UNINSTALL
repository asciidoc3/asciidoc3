AsciiDoc3 Uninstall Readme

Uninstall 'local' installation
If you have AsciiDoc3 installed 'local' - that means, you have all files in one 
directory (e.g., ~/asciidoc3) and never ran 'installscript'
(you have used 'python3 asciidoc3.py -a toc -a icons -n mytext.txt' or so):
just delete the directory '~/asciidoc3' (or wherever you have installed the distribution).


Uninstall system wide installation
If you ran the AsciiDoc3 'installscript' as root/superuser - that means, you have
directories/files like '/etc/asciidoc3/*.*', '/usr/share/asciidoc3/*.*' et al.
(you have used 'asciidoc3 -a toc -a icons -n mytext.txt' or so):
1. make 'uninstallscript' executable: 'chmod u+x uninstallscript',
2. 'su/sudo ./uninstallscript',
3. delete your 'local' files, e.g. in '~/asciidoc3'.
