# asciidoc3
## Text based document generation using Python 3.x; Python3 port of AsciiDoc

*AsciiDoc3* is a text document format for writing notes, documentation, articles, books,
ebooks, slideshows, web pages, man pages and blogs. *AsciiDoc3* files can be translated
to many formats including HTML, PDF, EPUB, man page, and DocBook markup (at your choice v4.5 or v5.1).
*AsciiDoc3* is highly configurable: both the *AsciiDoc3* source file syntax and the backend
output markups (which can be almost any type of SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended by the user.

## Prerequisites
*AsciiDoc3* is written in 100% pure Python3. So you need a Python interpreter (version 3.5 or later)
to execute asciidoc3.py. Python is installed by default in most Linux distributions. You can download
Python from the official website https://www.python.org.

## Obtaining AsciiDoc3
deb rpm packages tarball generic installer zip PyPI (GNU/Linux and Windows) Pelican Plugin available!
See documentation and installation instructions on the *AsciiDoc3* website https://asciidoc3.org/

## Tools
Current *AsciiDoc3* version tested on Debian Siduction, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa),
openSUSE Tumbleweed, Windows 10, and other platforms (Python 3.7.x / 3.8.x).

## Dependencies
*AsciiDoc3* comes without dependencies (aside Python3, of course). To exploit all features of *AsciiDoc3*,
you need - where necessary - DocBook XSL Stylesheets, xsltproc, w3m, dblatex, FOP, Pygments, graphviz ...
You'll find these packages in the repos of your operating system.
