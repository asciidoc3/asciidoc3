= AsciiDoc3 Installation

NOTE: AsciiDoc3 requires *Python 3.0 or newer*
to run. AsciiDoc3 will definitely crash when using Python2.x. Probably there are 
few systems in the real world running with Python 3.0, 3.1 or 3.2 any more. Python 3.3 / 3.4 / 3.5 / 3.6
is a good choice - but you don't need the most recent branch at all. Python is installed by
default in most Unix and GNU/Linux distributions. If you don't find an up-to-date version
of Python installed it can be downloaded from the official Python website http://www.python.org/.


[WARNING]
Command line 'python3' obligatory! +
Please note: To run AsciiDoc3, the executable command 'python3' is a must-have. That means, typing 'python3' at the command line starts the Python3 executable. In almost every Unix and GNU/Linux distribution this is a given. When not, you can easily add a symlink python3 -> python3.5 and add python3 to your PATH ... +
Windows users need probably a 'windows alias for python 3' - use this as a search phrase on the net. You can find more information about this issue here: +

== Obtaining AsciiDoc3
See link:download.html[here].

== Installation

=== Unix, GNU/Linux, BSD (and probably OS X, too)
Posix systems (Unix, GNU/Linux, BSD, and assumably OS X) go here.
 
You have two options to install AsciiDoc3:
- system wide (you need su/sudo/admin rights)
- 'local' in your home directory, no admin rights required (if Python etc. is already installed ...)


==== Install system wide (default)
- Download the tarball in any directory with read-write access, e.g. ~/download.
- Open a terminal and change to \~/download ('cd ~/download').
- Deflate the tarball to a new dir, say 'asciidoc3-3.0.1': 'tar -xzf asciidoc3-3.0.1.tar.gz'.
- You see a new directory ~/download/asciidoc3-3.0.1
- Recommended (but optional): Copy this new directory to your home directory
  and rename it to something like ~/ad3 (so you have less typing labour ...).
- In the terminal: change to the new directory, e.g. ~/ad3.
- Run 'installscript' as root/superuser:
  Ubuntu: 'sudo ./installscript'
  Other POSIX os like Debian, Fedora, BSD: 'su <password>  ./installscript' 
- AsciiDoc3 is ready to use ... (continue link:quickstart.html[here]).

- To avoid some configuration steps during daily routine you may consider the following directory layout:
 Copy/rename the deflated directory \~/download/asciidoc3-3.0.1 to \~/.asciidoc3 (with a dot - not visible to ls)
 and create a symlink to directory \~/ad3. This is because asciidoc3.py tries to find some configuration files
 in ~/.asciidoc3. See Userguide '26.11. Configuration file names, precedence and locations.' But that's optionally,
 everything works somehow or other. Symlinks don't work on partitions formatted as fat/vfat.
  

==== Install local
- Download the tarball in any directory with read-write access, e.g. ~/download.
- Open a terminal and change to \~/download ('cd ~/download').
- Deflate the tarball to a new dir, say 'asciidoc3-3.0.1': 'tar -xzf asciidoc3-3.0.1.tar.gz'.
- You see a new directory ~/download/asciidoc3-3.0.1
- Optional: Copy this directory and rename it to ~/asciidoc3 (so you have less typing labour ...)
- In the terminal: change to the new directory, e.g. ~/asciidoc3.
- Start using AsciiDoc3: ... ... (continue link:quickstart.html[here]).

- To avoid some configuration steps during daily routine you may consider the following directory layout:
 Copy/rename the deflated directory \~/download/asciidoc3-3.0.1 to \~/.asciidoc3 (with a dot - not visible to ls)
 and create a symlink to directory \~/ad3. This is because asciidoc3.py tries to find some configuration files
 in ~/.asciidoc3. See Userguide '26.11. Configuration file names, precedence and locations.' But that's optionally,
 everything works somehow or other. Symlinks don't work on partitions formatted as fat/vfat.

- To install 'local' as described before makes is easier to uninstall: just delete ~/ad3.


=== Windows (pending)
Zip Installation: Windows users may go here. +
AsciiDoc3 is developed and tested on GNU/Linux. I have only limited access to such systems. But as said in the
AsciiDoc v2 homepage, there seem to be quite a few people using it on Windows (I use the informations given there:). +

- To install AsciiDoc3 on Windows unzip the Zip file ('unzip asciidoc3-3.0.1.zip'),
- this will create the folder 'asciidoc3-3.0.1' containing the 'asciidoc3.py' and 'a2x3.py' executables along with configuration files,
- try 'python3 asciidoc3.py -n - icons -o ad3test.html ad3test.txt'... (continue link:quickstart.html[here]).

To generate DocBook based outputs (e.g. PDFs) you will also need a working DocBook toolchain. Installing and configuring a DocBook toolchain on Windows can be a challenge. If possible, I give you more information about this later on if this website will be updated.


=== Testing your installation
See link:quickstart.html[here].


== Uninstall
(this information is also given in file 'UNINSTALL' of the AsciiDoc3 distribution)

=== Uninstall local installation
If you have AsciiDoc3 installed 'local' - that means, you have all files in one 
directory (e.g., \~/asciidoc3) and never ran 'installscript'
(you have used 'python3 asciidoc3.py -a toc -a icons -n mytext.txt' or so):
just delete the directory '~/asciidoc3' (or wherever you have installed the distribution).

=== Uninstall system wide installation
If you ran the AsciiDoc3 'installscript' as root/superuser - that means, you have
directories/files like '/etc/asciidoc3/*.*', '/usr/share/asciidoc3/*.*' et al.
(you have used 'asciidoc3 -a toc -a icons -n mytext.txt' or so):
1. make 'uninstallscript' executable: 'chmod u+x uninstallscript',
2. 'su/sudo ./uninstallscript',
3. delete your 'local' files, e.g. in '~/asciidoc3'.
